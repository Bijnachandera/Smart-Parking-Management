# Smart-Parking-Management
Introduction: -
The effective management of parking spots has emerged as a critical concern in the face of growing urbanization. The dynamic demands of urban areas are frequently not met by traditional parking systems, which causes traffic jams, time wastage, and environmental issues. The emergence of Machine Learning (ML) technology offers a new approach to tackling these issues, with the possibility of developing a Smart Parking Management System that is more perceptive and clever.

Problem statement: -
Unpredictable urban parking demands are too much for conventional parking management systems to handle. It is difficult for users to find parking spots, which exacerbates traffic congestion, pollutes the environment, and lowers user happiness. The difficulty is in developing a system that, in addition to offering real-time information, forecasts future parking needs, maximizes resource allocation, and lessens the negative consequences of inefficient urban parking.
